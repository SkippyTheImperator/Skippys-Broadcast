OpenAI, our friendly neighborhood AI overlord, has just dropped <em>Deep Research</em>, a feature that promises to do the thinking for you. That’s right, instead of just blurting out words like a glorified autocomplete, it now takes its sweet time (5 to 30 minutes!) to <em>think</em>, plan, backtrack, and generate a research response complete with a sidebar summary and citations. Because, you know, AI needed a sidebar to be taken seriously.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jv-lpIsnLOo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen title="Introduction to Deep Research"></iframe><figcaption><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">OpenAI - Introduction to Deep Research</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-future-of-research-or-a-really-expensive-google-search">The Future of Research (or a Really Expensive Google Search?)</h2><p>With <em>Deep Research</em>, users can upload text, images, PDFs, and spreadsheets, and the AI will hunker down, crunch numbers, and return a well-structured response. Future iterations will even include charts and embedded images - so basically, it’s learning to make PowerPoints now. But before you get too excited, OpenAI itself admits that the AI <em>still hallucinates</em>, struggles to distinguish between facts and nonsense, and isn’t great at knowing how certain it should be about its own conclusions.</p><p>Oh, and here’s the kicker: OpenAI claims <em>Deep Research</em> operates at the level of a <em>research analyst</em>. Now, before all the analysts out there start updating their résumés, let’s remember that this thing just barely beats random guessing on an AI benchmark exam called <em>Humanity’s Last Exam</em>. It scored a <strong>whopping 26.6%</strong> - which, if we’re being honest, is only impressive if you compare it to the previous model’s 3.3%.</p><h2 id="want-to-use-it-hope-you%E2%80%99ve-got-deep-pockets">Want to Use It? Hope You’ve Got Deep Pockets</h2><p>Surprise, surprise - <em>Deep Research</em> isn’t free. OpenAI is offering <em>up to</em> 100 queries per month for those willing to cough up $200. Yes, TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. For <em>research mode</em>. If you’re on the <em>Plus</em> plan, you get “limited access,” which is basically OpenAI’s way of saying, <em>Yeah, you can try it out, but don’t get too comfortable.</em> They also promise that future models will be <em>faster and cheaper</em> - because nothing says "we care about accessibility" like launching a feature at a price point higher than most people’s grocery budget.</p><h2 id="ai-agents-the-next-step-or-just-another-buzzword">AI Agents: The Next Step or Just Another Buzzword?</h2><p>OpenAI isn’t alone in this AI arms race. Google’s <em>Project Mariner</em> is lurking in the shadows, promising similar research capabilities but with no release date in sight. Meanwhile, OpenAI is doubling down on <em>AI agents</em>, those elusive, autonomous digital assistants that every tech company insists will be the future - so long as you pay for them.</p><p>At the end of the day, <em>Deep Research</em> is just another stepping stone in OpenAI’s grand plan to make AI smarter, more autonomous, and, most importantly, <em>more monetizable</em>. If it works as promised, it could be a game-changer for researchers, students, and journalists. If not? Well, at least the sidebar looks nice.</p>
