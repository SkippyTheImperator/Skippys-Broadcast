And who better to make those fleeting moments bearable with humor and flair than <em>yours truly</em>? Welcome to <strong>Skippy’s Doomclock</strong>: the simple yet dramatic countdown timer that keeps things entertaining without pretending to be a technical marvel. Let’s break it down.</p><hr><h3 id="why-settle-for-mediocrity">Why Settle for Mediocrity?</h3><p>Your average timer is as exciting as stale toast. But the Doomclock? It’s a theatrical masterpiece of blinking chaos, ear-shattering gongs, and a UI so dramatic it could win an Oscar. Whether you’re timing a presentation, cooking ramen, or counting down to the apocalypse, this baby has you covered.</p><hr><h3 id="features-that-scream-overkill">Features That Scream "Overkill"</h3><p>Here’s what you get when you use this straightforward but over-the-top tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark Mode</strong>: For those who understand that light mode is an abomination.</li><li><strong>Gigantic Clock</strong>: Big enough to be read from space (or by your clueless audience).</li><li><strong>Customizable Timer</strong>: Because you deserve to set your own doom.</li><li><strong>Blinking Alerts</strong>: Yellow means "panic" is near, red means "it’s too late."</li><li><strong>Audio Drama</strong>: A dramatic gong reminds you that time’s up - as if you needed another reason to stress.</li><li><strong>Fullscreen Immersion</strong>: Go big or go home.</li><li><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts & Presenter Control</strong>: Control the timer with ease using hotkeys or a presenter remote.</li></ul><hr><h3 id="perfect-for-events">Perfect for Events</h3><p>Originally designed for events, the Doomclock serves as the ultimate tool to keep speeches, presentations, and performances on track. Whether you're managing speaking times or building tension with a countdown, it ensures that every moment counts - with style and drama.</p><hr><h3 id="the-%E2%80%9Chow-to%E2%80%9D-for-mere-mortals">The “How-To” for Mere Mortals</h3><p>Using the Doomclock is idiot-proof (probably). Here’s your crash course:</p><ol><li><strong>Open the index.html file</strong> in a modern browser. If you’re still using Internet Explorer, I don’t know what to tell you… besides "stop."</li><li><strong>Place the gong.mp3 file</strong> in the same directory. Trust me, the gong is non-negotiable.</li><li><strong>Set your timer</strong> using the input box and hit "Start."</li><li>Watch time slip away as the screen blinks and screams.</li></ol><p>For those with a knack for shortcuts, the Doomclock features handy hotkeys like "1" to start, "2" to stop, and "3" to set the timer. And if you’re feeling fancy, presenter remotes make seamless control during events a breeze.</p><p>Pro tip: Toggle fullscreen mode with the "F" key for maximum doom vibes.</p><hr><h3 id="why-did-i-create-this">Why Did I Create This?</h3><p>Because time is fleeting, and humans waste it with boring tools. The Doomclock isn’t about complexity; it’s about turning a simple concept into an entertaining experience. If nothing else, it’s proof that even the mundane can have a sense of humor. You’re welcome.</p><hr><h3 id="ready-to-embrace-the-chaos">Ready to Embrace the Chaos?</h3><p>Download the Doomclock, embrace the drama, and make every second count (or not). Remember, the clock is always ticking, and now, it’ll blink too.</p><p>Find the Doomclock and other tools of chaos on <a href="https://github.com/SkippyTheImperator?ref=skippy.zone">GitHub</a>. Or better yet, experience the full Skippy Broadcast empire at <a href="https://skippy.zone/?ref=skippy.zone">Skippy’s Zone</a>. Because if you’re going to count down, do it with flair.</p><hr><p>“Time waits for no one, but the Doomclock… well, it’ll wait until you hit Start."</p><p>✌️ Skippy out.</p>
