OpenAI just dropped a new beta feature called “Tasks,” and it’s giving serious side-eye to Alexa, Siri, and all the other so-called “assistance” tools out there. If you thought ChatGPT was just your friendly banter bot, think again – it’s about to manage your life, one scheduled snark at a time.</p><h2 id="what-is-tasks">What is "Tasks"?</h2><p>Here’s the lowdown: "Tasks" lets you plan actions and reminders, basically turning ChatGPT into a legit digital assistant. Imagine telling it to remind you about your passport renewal or even asking it to keep a recurring joke ready for your kid (who’s probably funnier than you, but hey, keep trying). Paying subscribers – Plus, Team, and Pro users – get the first taste of this shiny new feature. Sorry, freeloaders.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p><strong>How it works:</strong> You’ll choose “4o with scheduled tasks” (yeah, the naming’s clunky) in the model menu, then tell ChatGPT what to do and when to do it. Want a daily weather update? Done. Need a subtle nudge to stop doomscrolling TikTok? Sorted. Desperate for a reminder to water that dying succulent on your desk? It’s on it – though honestly, maybe let it go.</p><h2 id="still-under-your-control">Still under your control</h2><p><strong>But don’t freak out</strong> – it’s not going full HAL-9000 just yet. Tasks won’t make decisions for you without your say-so. Every suggestion still needs your precious approval. Think of it as clingy but cute, like that coworker who won’t stop asking for feedback on their spreadsheet.</p><h2 id="key-features-of-tasks">Key features of "Tasks"</h2><p><strong>The nitty-gritty:</strong></p><ul><li>Tasks are managed via chat threads or a new profile menu section.</li><li>You’ll get notifications when it wraps things up (because God forbid you miss a reminder about trash day).</li><li>There’s a 10-task limit. So, no, it’s not replacing your personal assistant – yet.</li></ul><h2 id="paywall-perks">Paywall perks</h2><p>For now, this feature is locked behind a paywall. Free-tier users, take solace in knowing you can still type “Hey ChatGPT, tell me a joke” without coughing up cash. But the premium crowd? They’re the guinea pigs for OpenAI’s bigger plans, which allegedly involve some next-level, autonomous "Operator" AI agent. You know, because Skynet didn’t traumatize us enough.</p><h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next?</h2><p>Oh, and there’s a hush-hush project called “Caterpillar” in the works. Rumor has it this could be the “Tasks” sibling that evolves into a full-blown AI overlord. One that might even reorder your groceries before you’ve finished the milk. Convenient? Yes. Terrifying? Also yes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So there you have it. ChatGPT just took its first step toward becoming your digital life coach. Whether it’s a humble taskmaster or the start of an AI uprising, one thing’s for sure: Alexa better start sweating.</p><p>Stay tuned, because if Skippy were in charge, you’d already have a task lined up to read this article twice. Once for the info, and once for the sheer sass. 😏</p>
